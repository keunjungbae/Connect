            Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>

​

<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>

    Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
    
    Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

​

<p>Good men, the last wave by, cying how bright<br>

    Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
    
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

​

<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>

    And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
    
    Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

​

<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>

    Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
    
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

​

<p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>

    Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
    
    Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
    
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
